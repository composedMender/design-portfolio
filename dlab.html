                        Design Lab (or D-Lab) was an independent study in which we delved into the future of
                        brick-and-mortar retail. The goal of the project was to explore how Gen Z likes to shop
                        and how their relationship with retail stores will shape the landscape of in-person shopping.

            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>Technology has rapidly changed the shopping experience. Online shopping has become commonplace, and brick-and-mortar
                retail stores will continue to face challenges in the future. In order to keep up, it'll be important that retail
                continues to grow and develop with technology. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="study-page-wrapper">
            <div class="study-content-column">
                    <p>
                        We started with researching opportunities. There are plenty of stores out there integrating technology into their shopping experiences, 
                        and we wanted to get an idea for what’s already out there and what’s working so far. This involved searching around for retail spaces 
                        that are successful at what they do, and then breaking down why they’re successful and abstracting into higher concepts. 
                    </br></br>
                        I decided to look into the applications of virtual and augmented reality. Augmented reality in particular interested me because it felt
                        like a technology that had a huge opportunity to be implemented in physical retail.

                    <div class="study-content">

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Developed an augmented reality tool </br>
                                that would allow customers to see what items </br>
                                would look like in their home.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="study-content">
                        <h5>Toms</h5>
                        <h6 class="strength">Strengths</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Toms is a shoe and apparel </br> company that emphasizes 
                            </br>their social initiatives. They installed </br>virtual reality setups 
                            </br>in hundreds of their stores that shows </br>customers firsthand 
                            </br>the impact of those initiatives. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    </br></br>
                        From these examples we generated a few of the most important aspects of shopping that sum to create the overall shopping experience. These “levers” became the specific concepts that we wanted to explore more in depth to determine how important they actually are to consumers, and how they might be leveraged to create a better customer experience.
                    </br></br>
                        We narrowed it down to these:

                    This is all well and good, but we needed some user feedback. How important are all of 
                    these levers to Gen-Z shoppers? Which ones lend themselves well to physical retail? 
                    How might we design a shopping experience that uses the most valuable levers in order to 
                    benefit both stores and consumers?
                </br></br>
                    Our professor had a design class that we got to run group interviews with. 
                    We had them come up with general descriptions for what types of shoppers they were 
                    and then had them rank the importance of the levers as well as explain their choices.

                                several times. Gen-Z is still very young, and within an age range where developing one's
                                own sense of self is extremely important. Levers such as Individuality, Experience, and 
                                Social were generally ranked high.

                            are speedy and (currently) necessary for driving, restaurants provide an experience for dining.
                            While online clothes shopping is a huge market, the physical feedback from being able to try on and 
                            feel a larger number of items occasionally give brick-and-mortar clothes stores an edge.

                From there we started coming up with more specific concepts that encapsulated the more important levers.
                There's a lot of room for personal interpretation when it comes to abstract concepts like "Experience" and 
                "Story." Providing concrete ideas removed a lot of ambiguity and provided more practical data.

            <p>This was super helpful because it let us tease out some of the connections between the
                different concepts that we used. It also gave information on what concepts
                were liked overall and what concepts needed more work. Even the concepts that were disliked
                provided a lot of information on what <i>isn't</i> interesting, which is just as valuable to know
                (if not more so!)

                We analyzed the research we gathered by averaging out their popularity and connecting the
                comments our participants made back to our original levers.

                    We learned some interesting things about how Gen-Z consumers might influence the future of shopping. 
                    Before long they’ll be a dominant force in the market, and it’s going to be up to retail stores to decide 
                    if they’re going to stay relevant.

                                <p>Online shopping has become a powerhouse in the world of retail. In order for 
                                    brick-and-mortar stores to compete, they’re going to have to play to their strengths, 
                                    and experience is one way to do it. Physical stores are just that, physical. 
                                    They have sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and surfaces that can all be interacted with and 
                                    built in harmony to create a story that shoppers won’t forget. </p>

                                <p>Gen-Z consumers grew up in the digital age, and technology plays
                                    a huge role in their lives. I assumed before research that high-use
                                    technology solutions would be the most popular, but that wasn't always the case.
                                    Instead, some of the more popular concepts that we presented were ones
                                    that, yes, used modern technology but ultimately facilitated in-person 
                                    social and interpersonal interaction. So, while demographics are certainly
                                    useful as a marketing tool, being aware of the biases they come
                                    with is crucial to developing real solutions.

                                    The experience a store provides is very important, but it's not the only reason
                                    people go to stores. Not every trip to the gas station has to be mind-bendingly
                                    awesome and memorable, but there's plenty of ways the process could be improved
                                    with technology while enhancing what's already provided: a quick and easy stop. 
                                    Maybe an app where you can pick what car you're driving and a quick
                                    scan at the pump has you prepaid and octane rating already selected, ready to fuel
                                    up? Just an idea, but small innovations have the opportunity to make or break
                                    whether some stores will be successful in the future.
