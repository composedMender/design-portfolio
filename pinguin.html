                    The current system for communicating college events has room to be improved,
                    either by improving the current systems or by developing a new one. This goes for both
                    how colleges communicate their events to students and how students communicate
                    between each other to discuss extracurriculars.

<!-- BACKGROUND -->
<section id="background"></section>
    <div class="study-page-wrapper">
        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>An important part of student life in college is attending extracurricular events. School events provide a place for 
            students to come together, meet each other, and enjoy time away from classes. A key task for schools then 
            is to inform their students about what's happening around campus.
            </br></br>
            My friend and I realized there was potential to improve the college
            experience for both schools and their students. Colleges' traditional means of communication
            aren't particularly effective, and other event services aren't made with
            these problems in mind. 
            </br></br>
            The question became then:
        </p>
        <blockquote><em>How might we build a system of communication between schools and students in order to build a stronger community?</em></blockquote>

        <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                Before attempting to create an entirely new product or solution, 
                I started doing research to understand what the market for event planning services looked like and where we could differentiate our 
                design. Then we could have a conversation with potential users to find some of the friction points surrounding school events.
            </p>
        <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
            <p>
                There is an extensive market for event related applications: Facebook Events, Meetr, Trip Advisor, Meetup, Eventbrite, just
                to name a few. 
                All of these services have different offerings and ways in which they differentiate, so
                I did some analysis on their strengths and weaknesses to get a better understanding of their positions in the
                market.

                We talked with
                school administration about how they marketed their events to students. On the student
                side, we talked with fellow classmates to try to get an understanding for how they
                went about finding extracurricular activities. Here's some of the key points that
                seemed to keep showing up:

        <p>
            Now that we had an idea of the differences between the school and the students, it was time to start defining some
            of the goals for the project. From the research it seemed there was a breakdown of communication between the school
            and the students. Our initial goals were:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Elaborate on who the product is for</li>
            <li>Determine important features</li>
            <li>Establish constraints</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>User Personas</h5>
        <p>There are a few different type of people that would use the service. Schools would use it
            as a means of communicating with their student bodies, and students would use it as a way to
            search for, explore, and plan things to do with friends.

        <h5>Goals and Constraints</h5>
        <p>After some consideration we felt that developing a standalone application that was unassociated with the school
            or another software was ideal for our situation. This would provide a solution that could theoretically be
            expanded upon much more easily, say, to apply to a different school.
        </br></br>
            We explored the idea of building a social media side to the solution, wherein users could better 
            interact with each other, form groups, and make/edit their own events. This became out of scope
            before too long, and we decided that focusing on the main issue of schools posting events and
            students discovering them would be best for a minimum viable product

                The home page ended up being somewhat complex, so I referenced Material Design to give the UI a stronger 
                sense of visual hierarchy. It was important to me that the pop-up information be understandable and usable 
                despite the complex background information from the map, and I found the Material guidelines worked the 
                best to communicate the depth of the different elements.

                My friend and I both come from a community college background before transferring, and while residential schools certainly have a more vibrant 
                social scene than commuter schools, the same problems with event communication continued to appear. As transfers we had the perspective of 
                students that missed their first two years at a 4-year school and the challenges of integrating that were presented as a result. There’s huge 
                potential for improving one of the most fundamental aspects of college, and we hope our solution addresses it.

                We didn’t end up finalizing the release of the service, so it’s impossible to make grand conclusions about how effective 
                the product is or would be. Despite this, I learned some very valuable lessons on taking a project from idea to reality:

                                there’s always room to improve how groups communicate with themselves, and making these improvements 
                                builds a more effective and beneficial system for everyone involved. </p>

                                One of the biggest changes I would make were I to go back to the beginning 
                                of the project would be how we conducted research. My process lacked structure 
                                and relied on informally and haphazardly getting insights from potential users. 
                                There were several occasions where I realized mistakes long after they could have 
                                been avoided had organized research taken place. Design doesn’t happen in a vacuum, 
                                and I learned that the hard way on this project.</p>

                                It’s easy for designers and developers to get caught up in their own language and jargon, 
                                which leads to details getting lost in translation. Even during moments of clear communication, 
                                I found that the capabilities of prototyping software are ultimately bound by the limitations 
                                of development: it doesn’t matter how cool a design is if it can’t be implemented. 
                                For that reason, clear, explicit design decisions make the implementation process that much 
                                smoother for everyone involved.
